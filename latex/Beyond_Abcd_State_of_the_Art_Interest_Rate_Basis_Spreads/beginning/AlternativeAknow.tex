\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

All my thanks go to Prof. Ferdinando Ametrano who I really appreciated because of his will to stimulate an endearing intellectual debate about quantitative finance and its life choices implications, Paolo Mazzocchi who gave me a friendly help to overcome crude technical problems, Luigi Ballabio and all QuantLib developers for their legacy and the Deloitte and Banca IMI colleagues, both from Product Control and Financial Engineering offices, for giving me insights which allowed me to produce a real world research.\\
Concluding, thanks to the University of Milano-Bicocca and its professors, especially Prof. Paola Bongini, for shaping my mind during these years.
