# Beyond Abcd: State of the Art Interest Rate Basis Spreads

Gabrele Giudici's Master Degree thesis (2019/03/22) realized with the precious support of F.M. Ametrano, L. Ballabio and P. Mazzocchi exploiting the QuantLib library.

After the 2007-2008 financial crisis, neglected interest rate tenor basis spreads arose invalidating previous interest rates curve modelling techniques. Searches for parsimonious models beyond numerical bootstrapping procedures led to the “abcd” parameterization of the interest rate basis spreads. This work improves the framework using more sensible parameters with increased financial and modelling meaning, while retaining a parsimonious parameterization.
